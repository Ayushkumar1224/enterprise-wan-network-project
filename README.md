# 🌐 Enterprise WAN Network Design & Implementation

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and hands-on implementation of a secure enterprise WAN connecting a headquarters and a branch office 300 kilometers apart, integrated with dual ISPs for redundancy and reliability.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Physical Cisco Routers & Switches (Lab environment)
- OSPF and Static Routing
- VLANs, NAT, DHCP, ACLs
- Site-to-Site IPSec VPN
- Microsoft Visio (for topology design)

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `diagrams/` – Network topology diagrams (Visio + exported PNG)
- `configs/` – Configuration files for routers and switches
- `documentation/` – Project report and IP addressing scheme

## 🧪 Hands-On Work
All configurations were applied and verified using real Cisco networking hardware, not just simulations.
